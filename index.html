                        <h1>This Project is Dedicated to My Dog, Dawson</h1>
                        <p class="first-p">She is currently 11 years old and wants a lot of yummy treats.<br>
                        She first was taken in from a shelter, along with 4 of her children by a friend of mine in 2016.<br>
                    One of her children was already an adult which my friend adopted. <br>
                The other 3 puppies had to be adopted one by one by puting advertisements on the internet.<br>
            All were adopted except Dawson since she was already 4 years old and nobody wanted her. <br>
        Since nobody wanted her she would have to go back to the shelter which she would be euthanized. <br>
    So, I adopted her and been with her since November 2016.</p>
